### Description
This folder contains step-by-step tutorial installing openWRT on TP Link MR4320 V5 Router. There are so many tutorials scattered on the internet on how to flash openWRT firmware to this router. I had to test it one by one, whether it's working or not. That waste a lot of time. Since no clear tutorial on how to flash openWRT firmware on TP Link MR4320 V5, so I decided to make it myself. The only working steps to flash an OpenWrt image to TL-MR3420 v5 is to use tftp recovery mode in U-Boot. I'll explain it below.
